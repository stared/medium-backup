As far as I remember, in “The Masters of Doom” (a story of Wolfenstein, Doom and Quake creators, which I recommend wholeheartedly) there were notes of Dungeons&Dragon culture, which provided social support for young boys, who otherwise felt excluded. (If I recall correctly, around a discussion of a mass shooting, were they found that the shooter was an avid Doom player.)

One thing is “feeling like trash”. But (as you notice) it stems from being an outcast. So yes, deglorifying violence is one thing. But giving people sense of worth and community the key factor. (As a side note, nn “Freakonomics” there was a chapter on people joining Ku Klux Klan primarily for these reasons).
