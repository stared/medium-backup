Hey Fabrizo,

and thank you for the references. Though, my motivations are more mundane — providing a shorthand notation (reducing the number of indices and other error-prone spots, showing symmetries graphically, etc), nothing more or less. Just n-dimensional arrays (for the sake of this argument I am happy to restrict everything to finitely dimensional spaces), and summations.

For contracting indices, there is nothing to prove, seriously. Everything else verges on being abstract nonsense\[\*\] OR falls back to things beyond maths itself (e.g. perception: how to tell if a symbol is ‘i’ or ‘j’).

  

  

  
\[\*\] Mentally I am a physicist. So, I don’t mind some hand-waving (e..g started using Dirac deltas well before learning about distributions) but have a low tolerance towards abstract nonsense (i.e. a layer of abstraction, that)
