<warning>Opinionated</warning>

I never thought that there is an art in naming projects… 

-   [livelossplot](https://github.com/stared/livelossplot) — tracking deep learning training in Jupyter
-   Confrenzy — an academic conference listing
-   [Offtopicarium](http://offtopicarium.wikidot.com/en:about) — an unconference on any topic
-   In Browser AI — an educational project with TensorFlow.JS and related technologies
-   [ Quantum Game with Photons](http://quantumgame.io/) — an open source puzzle with real quantum mechanics), etc.

…until I saw others doing so. Hard to remember, find, and even if I do so it’s hard to spread the word.

### Questions

So, if you have a name, go with these:

-   Is it memorizable?
-   Is it google-able?
-   Is it recognizable?
-   Bonus, if people can guess what is that about from its name.

It takes, I don’t know, 15 minutes to check. But if you fail at this step, people won’t memorize it, won’t find it… or even if they do, they won’t realize what’s that about. They won’t use it, won’t tell their friends… and guess what: their friends won’t tell it, and… you get the idea.

### Names

#### Good

Facebook, Hacker News, TensorFlow, Markdown, Dropbox, three.js, 1password, Evernote, matplotlib, MATLAB, StarCraft, Inkscape, MagicaVoxel, etc.

#### Bad

I don’t know many…but ones I know are those whom I know personally.  
There are two possibilities — my connections are worse at creating good product names… or we have some [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias). 

#### Ugly

Except for [thefacebook (they dropped the ‘the’)](https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/17/facebook-3/), there are some internet masterpieces: [Top 10 Worst Domain Names](http://blog.dreamhosters.com/2006/07/26/top-10-worst-domain-names/ "Permanent Link: Top 10 Worst Domain Names") and 30 [Unintentionally Inappropriate Domain Names](https://www.boredpanda.com/worst-domain-names/).

### Buts

But, but… Google can name their language “Go” and it still works! Well, you are not Google! (Even with R occasionally it gets hard to google things, and one need to resort to “r-lang” term search.)

But, but… there are so many projects that use common words. Python, Tinder. Well, once you get popular, it may be beneficial. But you are not there yet. At least, make sure that if they add. For example, if you create a new dating site, don’t call it “Carbon” or “Unix”.

But, but… xkcd is called xkcd. Well, you are not xkcd! Your fate is closer to some Unix commands:

### Checks

So, how to check that?

-   Can people remember this name? (Bad: misspell, worse: memorize a different name/product, worst: accidentally summon Cthulhu.)
-   Can people google it? (Bad: there are other hits, but with very different products, worse: they are hits with products on a similar topic, worst: …and they pick them instead.)
-   Can they later tell what’s the product about? (Bad: not much, worse: they think it does something totally different, worst: …and it is a thing they don’t even need.)

### Flags 🚩🚩🚩

Big red flags (pretty much you should act immediately) is when people:

-   Often mistake your product.
-   Cannot find it on Google.
-   It takes them too much time to recall what’s your product about, anyway?
-   You misspell it as well.

No, it’s never people’s mistake. It’s never “I told you, you spell it ‘dsbfuwhaah’ not ‘dsbfoowhah’!”. Or “oh, you need to google for ‘\[my\_product\] machine learning’, not ‘\[my\_product\] deep learning’”. You may be technically correct (e.g. your product name is actually from Latin), yet you will never have a chance to educate all of your prospective users!

### Hows

-   Brainstorm product ideas. Start with at least 20 or so.
-   Pick a few most relevant.
-   Check if the domain is taken or the name have a product with the same name.
-   It if works, test on a few friends close to the target, who know little about the project.

If necessary, repeat.

### Hacks

Slightly easier with JavaScript, as you can name virtually anything, and use name.js. Or with deep learning — just append “.ai” and it works! And if there is a domain, you can even take name-generation.ai.

Also, one more hint — if you create a great name, buy a domain before sharing it on a public forum. :)
