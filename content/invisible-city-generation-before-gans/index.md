[“Invisible Cities” by Italo Calvino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Cities) intuitions of probabilistic content generation.

> If such a city is the most improbable, by reducing the number of abnormal elements, we increase the probability that the city really exists. So I have only to subtract exceptions from my model, and in whatever direction I proceed, I will arrive at one of the cities which, always as an exception, exist. But I cannot force my operation beyond a certain limit: I would achieve cities too probable to be real.

  

  

  

And would it work for Invisible Cities? Well, let’s see:
