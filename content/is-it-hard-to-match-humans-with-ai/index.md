Singularity, but not one we fought for.

There is a lot of discussions

  

\[plot\] 

Do we need:

-   burn more computer power (LINK)
-   gather more training data
-   new architectures

(Paradigm shift, or that it is utterly impossible — I don’t belive that)

But what if the other plot 

  

  

Einsteins, Bethovens

  

This is 

  

  

-   An average medical doctor: overworked, underslept, under peer pressure
-   An average driver: tired, distracted by text messages and passengers, in hurry
-   An average person: age, racially, class, and gender-biased in one way or the other AND not aware of that
-   An average commenter: check out YouTube comment section and judge for yourself
